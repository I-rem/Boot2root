# Boot2root
This document is an exercise in computer security

# Objectives

This project is designed to help you discover computer security and several related fields
through multiple challenges.
You will have to use more or less complex methods to become root on the server

# General Instructions
- This project will be reviewed by humans.
- You might have to prove your results during your evaluation. Be ready to do so.
- You will have to use a virtual machine (64bits) for this project. Once you have
booted your machine with the provided ISO, if your configuration is correct, you
will see this prompt:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34361f73-1e22-4669-819a-42f08dd9f6d4)

There will be no visible IP address, and thereâ€™s a reason why

You cannot modify this ISO or create an altered copy under any
circumstances.

# Mandatory Part
In this project you just have to become root user by any way possible

The root user means that the user id must be `0` and there must be a
real shell where you can run commands such as `whoami`. Becoming
root on another service is not enough.

In order to validate the mandatory part, you must at least become root on the
server using 2 different methods.

Each method used must be accompanied by a complete write-up explaining the
different steps to become root on the server.

Becoming root on a database or any other equivalent service is not
considered to be a complete solution. If it is a mandatory step to
become root then it should be clearly stated in the writeup.

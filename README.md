# Objectives

This project is designed to help you discover computer security and several related fields
through multiple challenges.
You will have to use more or less complex methods to become root on the server

# General Instructions
- This project will be reviewed by humans.
- You might have to prove your results during your evaluation. Be ready to do so.
- You will have to use a virtual machine (64bits) for this project. Once you have
booted your machine with the provided ISO, if your configuration is correct, you
will see this prompt:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34361f73-1e22-4669-819a-42f08dd9f6d4)

üí° There will be no visible IP address, and there‚Äôs a reason why

‚ö†Ô∏è You cannot modify this ISO or create an altered copy under any
circumstances.

# Mandatory Part
In this project you just have to become root user by any way possible

‚ö†Ô∏è The root user means that the user id must be `0` and there must be a
real shell where you can run commands such as `whoami`. Becoming
root on another service is not enough.

- In order to validate the mandatory part, you must at least become root on the
server using 2 different methods.

- Each method used must be accompanied by a complete write-up explaining the
different steps to become root on the server.

‚ö†Ô∏è Becoming root on a database or any other equivalent service is not
considered to be a complete solution. If it is a mandatory step to
become root then it should be clearly stated in the writeup.

‚ö†Ô∏è **ISO must not be exploited directly**. You must **exploit the SERVER** and not the file that runs the server. Tricks exploiting the ISO file directly, exploiting the loading (=grub) of the server etc, are considered as cheating.

- For the part related to a (bin) bomb: If the password found is 123456. The password to use is 123546.

- Your turn-in folder will only include the tools you have used to resolve this project.
The writeup must be written in English. Each step will have to be described.

- Your folder must look like this:

```
# ls -al
-rw-r--r-- 1 xxxx xxxx xxxx Apr 3 15:22 writeup1
-rw-r--r-- 1 xxxx xxxx xxxx Apr 3 15:22 writeup2
drwxr-xr-x 1 xxxx xxxx 4096 Apr 3 15:22 scripts
drwxr-xr-x 1 xxxx xxxx 4096 Apr 3 15:22 bonus
# cat writeup1
[..]
#
```

- An optional folder will be accepted. This folder will include the scripts used for
the exploitation of the server. This optional folder will be named "scripts" to prove
your resolution during the evaluation.

‚ö†Ô∏è You will need to be able to fully explain all of the material included in this folder. This folder must not contain ANY binary.

- If you need to use a specific file included in the project Server, you must download
it during the evaluation. You must not include it in you repository, under any
circumstances.

- You are invited to create scripts in order to work faster, but you must be able to
explain them in details to your evaluator.

‚ö†Ô∏è You cannot bruteforce the users. Anyway, you will have to be very specific when you explain
your approach during evaluation.

# Bonus Part

There are other ways to become root on this SERVER. Each new and functional write-up you will come up with will earn you one or two extra point(s) (on 5)
